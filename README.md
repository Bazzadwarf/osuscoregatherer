# osuscoregatherer

osuscoregatherer is a small program for gathering a collection of user scores from bancho.

I created this for helping out with the research for the [History of osu! Rank 1 Wiki Page](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/4720).

I might expand this out into a proper program somewhere down the line, but at the moment, it's very much a WIP test.
